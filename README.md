# Hacktober-Challenges

A collection of issues for beginners for Hacktoberfest challenges! I review PR's daily!

NOTE: Please tell me at least one thing you learned from doing this in your PR comment! AND NO REUSING OLD CODE!!!!

I will be spending the next hour or so making a bunch of python challenges for people to complete and make a PR

Make sure to make a folder with a name for the issue you want to have a go at! If someone has already done it, just add your version inside of that folder in your PR. Enjoy the t-shirts! Also remember that fixing other peoples code is allowed too! If you spot a mistake just make another PR! :D

Be sure to star! Or DM for any help! JamBot3000#5181
